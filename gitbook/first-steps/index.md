# First steps

Now that we have set up our development setup and learned the basics about React
and EcmaScript 6, we will start by creating a simple React based webapplication
by the use of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
that will include a simple react-geo component. This application will be extended
towards a fully functional mapping application little by little later on.
