ES (ECMAScript) is a trademarked scripting-language specification created to standarize JavaScript.
AS the name suggests, ES6 (later renamed to ES2015) is the sixth edition and came with significant new syntax for writing complex applications,
including classes and modules. Some Browsers do not (or only partially) support ES6, but the ES6 code can be transpiled in
ES5, which enjoy a broader compability.

JavaScript frameworks and libraries to build modern web-applications are written in ES6.
